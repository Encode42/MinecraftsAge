# ðŸ”’ Archival Notice
This repository has been archived. However, the project is not dead! Instead, it lives on through [SimplyMC](https://www.simplymc.art/), where a team is able to maintain it, alongside many other useful Minecraft tools.

[Issues on this repository](https://github.com/encode42/minecrafts.date/issues) will still be worked on, and new features will be added to SimplyMC's rendition of the website.

> [!WARNING]
> This means that the current domain, `minecrafts.date`, will eventually cease to function. It will redirect to `simplymc.art/dates` until expiry. It's strongly recommended to switch any `minecrafts.date` links over to `simplymc.art/dates` once the transfer is finished!

This was a sister project to [flags.sh](https://github.com/encode42/flags.sh). They were often developed in parallel, both benefiting from my discoveries made while working on the other. As such, it has experienced the same fate. If you would like to learn more, read the archival statement made in [flags.sh's readme](https://github.com/encode42/flags.sh/blob/main/readme.md).

**If you have any questions or concerns, please [contact me](https://encode42.dev/discord)! I am always here to help.**
